The story thus far: 

- We are working on a new set of measures for probabilistic networks (applied to ecology)
- I am developing the implementation in parallel to the main text of the paper
- I am doing real-time testing and juggling several repos at once
- I only move forward with writing something if the test suite passes, and code coverage increases

What I'll do in the chapter:

- Talk a bit about the (scientific) problem, and why it required a new method
- Discuss why we wanted to provide an implementation as well as a paper
- Show how the paper was built *around* the program, not the other way around
- Outline the various issues / challenges / things I've learned
- Try to give some sort of roadmap for people that want to do the same
